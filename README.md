HTML Assessment README
##Overview:
This HTML document was developed using ATOM as the text editor.

##Description
Development of assessment.html began as a structured HTML document skeleton,
including a document title.  Next, the section header with the title of
"LIST" that organized the teams by team name, position, and player was added. 
Finally, I added a new section with the heading "FORM". Under it create a form
element.

##Technologies
ATOM as the text editor
GitHub

##Lessons learned
I found it useful to view the final HTML output periodically throughout the
document development process to ensure the output was correct.  It was also
useful to learn ATOM shortcut keys.  Overall, this was a good opportunity to
apply basic HTML markup knowledge to develop a project that can be improved
with CSS.
