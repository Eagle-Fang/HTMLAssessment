HTML Assessment README

##Overview:
This HTML document was developed using ATOM as the text editor.

##Description
Development of assessment.html began as a structured HTML document skeleton, including a document title.
Next, I added the section header with the title of "LIST" that organized the teams by team name, position, and player.
Finally, I added a new section with the heading "FORM".

##Technologies
ATOM as the text editor
GitHub

##Lessons learned
I found it useful to view the final HTML output periodically throughout the document development process to ensure the
output was correct. It was also useful to learn ATOM shortcut keys. Overall, this was a good opportunity to apply basic
HTML markup knowledge to develop a project that can ultimately be improved with CSS.
